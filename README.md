This code belongs to the algorithm code in the paper "Targeting and Structural Engineering of light-responsive nanoprobe for Hierarchical Therapy: Construction, Optimization, and Applications in Cancer Stem Cells", which has been submitted to the JMCB journal. We will upload the relevant datasets and detailed codes immediately after the paper is accepted.
As for machine learning, we employed four models, including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM, to predict SF and optimize the experimental parameters. The data were split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, and a 5-fold cross-validation approach was applied to ensure model robustness. We preprocessed the data by normalizing the input features to eliminate dimensionality effects. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using BayesSearchCV to achieve optimal performance for each model. Among the tested algorithms, CatBoost demonstrated the best performance, significantly outperforming the other models.
